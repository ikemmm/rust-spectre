# rust-spectre
A Rust variant of the Spectre Variant 1 attack formulated in my bachelor research. The original thesis text explores the *feasibility of exploitation of the Spectre vulnerability in security-focused languages*, from which Rust is taken as a prime example.

Read the **thesis** text [here](./thesis.pdf).

A functioning **proof-of-concept** implementation of the attack is located [here](./src/main.rs).
